# Comparative Study of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms on Highway Environment

## Overview

Our work aims to conduct a comparative analysis of reinforcement learning algorithms using the highway-environment developed by OpenAI Gymnasium. Specifically, we focus on three main methods: Deep Q-learning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Actor-Critic. While previous research exists on the highway-environment, there is limited exploration of these specific algorithms. We believe it would be valuable to implement these algorithms from scratch and evaluate their performance on this environment.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to compare the effectiveness and performance of Deep Q-learning, PPO, and Actor-Critic algorithms in navigating the highway-environment. By implementing these algorithms from scratch and conducting experiments, we seek to gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for autonomous driving scenarios.

## Features
- Deep Q-learning, Actor-Critic Methods and Proximal Policy Optimization are compared
- Implementation of algorithms from scracth
- Evaluation of algorithms' performance on the highway-environment.
- Generation of insights into algorithm behavior and effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios.
